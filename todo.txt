TODO

Run trace back to where it came from on MOAR data -- might not have enough loops in each bin (5k loops? 5k files (will be ~62k loops)? what do we want to limit by?)
Histogram - x is model.size, y is # models
X-Val - n folds -- how close is the structure to the first predicted structure?
	Todo: (low priority) how close to the second? third? how to weight it?!
Different weights for structure comparison

Feature vector - merge 3d structure, anchor angle, anchor dist, frame --- weighting feature vectors by size of the models
Play with search parameters (RMSD? limit loop length 7-9)
