TODO

Run trace back to where it came from on MOAR data -- might not have enough loops in each bin (5k loops?)
Histogram - x is model.size, y is # models
X-Val - n folds -- how close is the structure to the first predicted structure?
	Todo: (low priority) how close to the second? third? how to weight it?!
Different weights for structure comparison
